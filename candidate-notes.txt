These are the packages used for the challenge implementation:

Google Maps Flutter: https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter -> Show the map in the second tab

Geolocator: https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator ->  Update the map to the user current location.

HTTP: https://pub.dev/packages/http -> Make http request to access the JSON data.

Cache Network Image: https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image -> Show the articles images

URL-Launcher: https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher -> Show the webpage of the articles when the user clicks on them

-> I leaved an placeholder for the Google Maps API key in the AndroidManifest.xml and the AppDelegate.swift files.

-> All the project functionality was tested on Android because I donÂ´t have access to an iPhone but did all the steps so the packages work on both platforms.

-> Any feedback is appreciated.
